# water_pumps_faults
Repo for final project of Introduction to Data Science course @ Skoltech '21

## Requirements
- numpy==1.20.3
- pandas==1.3.4
- tqdm==4.62.3
- xgboost==1.6.1
- scikit-learn==0.24.2
- matplotlib==3.4.3
- seaborn==0.11.2

## Idea

The idea of the project is to make classificator for water pump in Tansania. For this task we applied different classical machine learning models, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and KNN + we make stacked model of majority voting.

## Repository contents

| File or Folder | Content |
| --- | --- |
| data | the folder contains train and test datasets, contains information about water pumps in Tanzania |
| Pump.ipynb | jupyter notebook contains EDA and machine learning models|

## Results

Gradient Boosting model perform the best. We achieve Accuracy 0.81 and F1 0.8 using this model.
